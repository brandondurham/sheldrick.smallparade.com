My name is Brandon Durham. I’ve been a _Software Engineer_ and _Designer_ professionally for 18 years. My primary focus has always been front-end development with a strong interest in its relationship to design. I’m a developer first, a designer second, and just love the intersection of the two. In today’s world I would likely be considered more of a _<a href="#generalist" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="generalist-ref">Generalist</a>_.

I’ve worked my fair share of jobs for the paycheck. I almost always enjoy the work itself, so I’ve been able to convince myself that I’m fulfilled. But that has become more and more difficult to do as time goes by. It’s time for a change, and that’s where Sheldrick Wildlife Trust comes in.

I’ve had an extraordinary relationship with animals throughout my life. I close my eyes and I’m 7 years old, feeding an orphaned calf every morning by bottle before catching the bus; helping rescue malnourished and abused animals from neglectful neighbors alongside my sister; wrestling with our oversized Spanish goat for fun; racing passing cargo trains on the family horse _Misty_; sharing an ice cream cone with my best friend _Puppy Jane_, a German Shepard mix with a crooked ear. I open my eyes and I’m 45, having a mature conversation with 12-year-old Chocolate Labrador _Junebug_ about death; cradling _Thurston_—a 19-year-old cat that has seen more of the world than most of my family—as he passes peacefully in my arms from kidney disease. They’ve always been here, and I don’t know what I would do without them.

When I think about the organizations I would most love to dedicate my time and capabilities to—organizations that would allow me to do what I love while simultaneously giving me the opportunity to help make a difference in a way that I most connect with—Sheldrick Wildlife Trust is the only obvious option.

I have a job. By nearly all measures you could say it’s good one. But at the end of the day I’m really just helping someone make money when more than anything I want to be proud of the work I do and the positive change it helps incite.

So, in an effort to be proactive and try to make that happen I’ve decide to court my dream organizations, the first of which is _Sheldrick Wildlife Trust_.

  <li>
    <a href="https://amemoirproject.com/" target="_blank"><strong>A Memoir Project</strong></a> My partner at the time had been considering writing a memoir for years but was feeling stuck, and the idea of shopping his work around made the task feel all the more daunting. I came up with the idea of releasing his memoir as an online serial, with one chapter being published every two weeks. Each chapter would get the “book” treatment, complete with a cover image; considered typographic treatments; high-res tactile scans of related family photos; and occasionally accompanied by audio and/or video clips. The site garnered several awards for design and creativity and had several thousand visitors per week. I handled all design as well as front- and back-end development.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://typography.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Hoefler&Co</strong></a> In 2012 I threw caution to the wind and applied for a position with my design heroes of many years, Hoefler&Co (né Hoefler & Frere-Jones). In lieu of a traditional resumé I made a special site for them, much like I have with this page for Sheldrick Wildlife Trust. It worked! I spent eight of the best professional years of my life working on wildly progressive and creative projects and launched some of the best work I’ve ever been a part of, the biggest being the redesign of <a href="https://typography.com/" target="_blank">the company site</a>. Other notable projects included a custom browser-based type-testing tool called <a href="https://try.typography.com/" target="_blank">Try.typography</a>; a graphic-design-heavy type showcase called <a href="https://discover.typography.com/" target="_blank">Discover.typography</a>; and one of the world’s biggest subscription services for boutique webfonts, <a href="https://www.typography.com/webfonts" target="_blank">Cloud.typography</a> (now part of Monotype). Some of my work with H&Co was featured in Netflix’s <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80057883" target="_blank">Abstract</a> documentary series (season 2, episode 6).
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.baltimorebrew.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Baltimore Brew</strong></a> Baltimore Brew is an independent daily news website, staffed by veteran journalists committed to providing fresh, fair, insightful and reliable reporting about Baltimore, Maryland. Created in partnership with <a href="https://www.posttypography.com/" target="_blank">Post Typography</a> who designed the site, I built a full <small><abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr></small> with an <small><abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr></small> layer for the front-end to communicate with via a <small><abbr title="Representational State Transfer">REST</abbr>ful</small> interface. The <small>CMS</small> included several custom user permissions levels managed by the CEO, allowing reporters to manage their content and only their content. I also handled all front-end development, which included ensuring the site was fully-responsive and rendered correctly and efficiently on any device.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://besthorrorscenes.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Best Horror Scenes</strong></a> As odd as it may sound, one of my first loves in life was for Horror films and television. At a very young age I began sneaking into our living room after hours and watching <em>Alfred Hitchcock Presents</em> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Saturday_Nightmares" target="_blank"><em>USA Saturday Nightmares</em></a>, a Horror movie showcase series that ran Saturday nights from 1984 to 1994 on the USA Network (often “stranding” myself in the living room for fear of being eaten by something in the long, dark hallway to my bedroom). This project is my ongoing love letter of the genre and its better entries (subjectively speaking, of course). I handled all design as well as front- and back-end development.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://palaxytracks.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Palaxy Tracks</strong></a> My first real creative outlet was music. After years of playing in other peoples’ bands I created my own. Palaxy Tracks was active from 1997 to 2017, releasing a total of 7 albums. This site acts as a compendium for these releases. I handled all design as well as front- and back-end development.

    content: `I’ve handled many different roles over the years. While working with a small company called Adlucent (2008–2012) I acted as the sole _Senior Front-end Developer_; _Lead Designer_; and managed all of my own projects. I tackled a wide array of projects there, including redesigning and developing the company site; designing t-shirts and conference materials; and building many landing pages for clients that included <a href="#multivariate" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="multivariate-ref">Multivariate</a> and <a href="#ab" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="ab-ref">A/B</a> tests. While with Fringe (2020–2023) I acted primarily as _Lead Engineer_ managing a small team of developers, but also took on an interim role as _Design Director_ and managed a team of three. In my longest stint (Hoefler&Co, 2012–2020) I acted as a _Full-stack Developer_, a _Designer_, and managed several other developers during this time. I also designed and developed a proprietary <abbr title="Customer Relationship Manager"><small>CRM</small></abbr> that is still in use to this day.
    
All this to say I bring a good bit of experience to the table. I would love to help you manage anything web-related for Sheldrick Wildlife Trust. I can also help with most anything design-related, but my primary comfort zone is in front-end development and design for the web.

I’m at home with my head in the details. I consider work an ongoing education and thrive on learning new and better ways to achieve my goal: creating a positive user experience with semantic, concise, and meaningful code. Depending on the audience, that can call for a relatively traditional and accessible interface, or something more experimental and unexpected.

My ultimate goal is to obtain a full-time position, but I would be more than happy considering a contract-to-hire or even a full- or part-time contract position, as long as it meant working with Sheldrick Wildlife Trust.

> “Brandon’s an outstandingly talented developer, a thoughtful and constructive collaborator, ten times the designer that he thinks he is, and just one of my favorite people. I count myself immensely fortunate that his sensitivity to typography brought him to Hoefler&Co where I had the pleasure of working with him for eight of my company’s most energetic years, and I’m happy to call him a friend.
>
> Over these years, Brandon was instrumental in the design and development of not only typography.com, which underwent both evolutionary and revolutionary changes, but also the award-winning and influential [Discover.typography](https://discover.typography.com), which raised the bar for typography in the browser. Brandon took the reins of our <small>saas</small> product [Cloud.typography](https://cloud.typography.com), and was an absolutely critical part of my team that was charged with creating an elegant front-end to conceal the massively complex set of decisions required of a sophisticated font library. Behind the scenes, Brandon dealt smartly and confidently with the demanding back-end integrations of two different content management systems, a best-of-breed <small>CDN</small>, and a sophisticated internal <small>CRM</small> that he designed while tackling the public-facing websites at the same time. I was always grateful for not only Brandon’s talents and energies but his ideas and opinions, his honesty, his good humor, his eagerness to simultaneously explore new technologies while committing to time-tested ones, his patience with the limited resources of an established company (bootstrapped, profitable, old-school), and his camaraderie with a diverse group of colleagues. I know him to have been both a generous collaborator and a good friend to the many designers, developers, engineers, managers, and typeface designers he worked with at H&Co, and I’d recommend him without hesitation to absolutely anyone with the good fortune to be considering him for a project.”

No matter what happens I understand this is quite the long shot. I just couldn’t pass up the opportunity to throw my name in the hat, even if it’s entirely probable that there isn’t actually a hat to throw it into. :)

Thank you for your time and consideration. I hope to hear from you soon!
